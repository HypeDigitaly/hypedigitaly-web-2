## [2026-01-14] Feature: Automated Confirmation Email for Form Submitters
- Implemented a professional confirmation email for users submitting the contact form.
- The email includes a "thank you" message, 24-hour response promise, featured YouTube video ("AI v praxi"), and links to social media (LinkedIn, Instagram, Facebook, YouTube).
- Refactored `contact.ts` into a modular structure with `email-templates.ts` to stay under the 500-line limit.
- Verified type safety and project history updated.
